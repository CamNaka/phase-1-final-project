# Golf store
This project will be a shopping oriented web page where you can look through different listed items that will load when you open the page. You will be able to click on a 'add to cart' button for a specific item and the item price will be added to the top, for each item you add the total price will increment by the cost of the added items, if you want to empty your shopping cart there will be a button for you to click that will empty the shopping cart and restart the total count. For users who are interested there will be an information submit at the bottom of the page that wil asks for your name and email; all without reloading the web page.
